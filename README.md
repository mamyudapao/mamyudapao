 Hey, I'm Kenichi

**Software Engineer** building distributed systems at DeNA.

Currently re-architecting a live streaming service — migrating from a Rails monolith to **Go + Kubernetes microservices** with stateful architecture, gRPC bidirectional streaming, and Redis Streams.

### What I work with

```
Go  |  Kubernetes  |  gRPC  |  Redis Streams  |  Microservices
```

### What I'm into

- Stateful distributed systems (in-memory state, Push/Drain, graceful shutdown)
- Event-driven architecture & message bus patterns
- Service discovery & broker patterns
